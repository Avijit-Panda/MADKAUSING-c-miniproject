so i tried to be the one i wanted to see
but i cried to see what it would do 
i tried to believe all these legacies
but in the end nothing was true

when i try to spread  my feathers
its always a free fall no stall 
cuz afterall nothing really matters
its always the time i spend with u

cha cha cha cha

k im done pretendin 
keepin it inside was tryin to send it
condescending,patronizing 
all these feelings are extremizin
peepin inside is wat i need
these shots i take sow them seeds
all these thots make em bleed
keepin deez ,a brain freeze
so cold,thots racing on ice skis
cuz in the end i try to be
a brain mend,Er i try to see
with all these people Eh watchin me
its hard to find the whats inside me
whats inside me ..inside me

Cuz all these thoughts are watching me.
i never ever want to be 
the person that wants to see
the thoughts and things that are inside me
